## Filtering Rows and Columns

In the installed packadge SQL we are able to filter columns by using SELECT and rows by using WHERE. For refrence we will use and example from the Lahman Baseball database. 
* 1) Load the Lahman Packadge and also the sqldf packadge

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)

```
```{r}
query<-"select playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting
Where teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
